				<h1 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">About Initiative Tracker</h1>
				
				<p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-8">
					A modern, free initiative tracker built for Dungeon Masters who want to spend less time managing combat and more time creating memorable encounters.
				</p>

				<section class="mb-12">
					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						Running combat in Dungeons & Dragons should be exciting, not overwhelming. As Dungeon Masters, we've all experienced the chaos of managing initiative, tracking hit points, remembering status effects, and looking up monster stats - all while trying to create an engaging battle.
					</p>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						Initiative Tracker was created to solve this problem. We believe that better tools lead to better games. By automating the tedious parts of combat management, DMs can focus on what matters most: storytelling, tactics, and player engagement.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section class="mb-12">
					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Why We Built This</h2>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						After years of DM'ing with pen and paper, spreadsheets, and various online tools, we knew there had to be a better way. Existing initiative trackers were often:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-muted-foreground space-y-2 mb-4">
						<li>Too complicated with features that got in the way</li>
						<li>Behind paywalls or subscription models</li>
						<li>Requiring accounts and personal data</li>
						<li>Slow to load with clunky interfaces</li>
						<li>Lacking modern features like AI assistance</li>
						<li>Not mobile-friendly for use at the table</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						We built Initiative Tracker to address all these issues. It's fast, free, privacy-respecting, and packed with genuinely useful features that enhance rather than complicate your game.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section class="mb-12">
					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">What Makes Us Different</h2>

					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Completely Free</h3>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						No subscriptions, no "premium" tiers, no paywalls. Every feature is free forever. We believe great D&D tools should be accessible to everyone, whether you're a veteran DM or running your first game.
					</p>

					</p>

					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">AI-Powered Without Hassle</h3>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">

						Your encounters and data never leave your device. No tracking, no analytics, no selling your data. Just a tool that respects your privacy.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section class="mb-12">
					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Technology Stack</h2>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						Initiative Tracker is built with modern web technologies:

				</section>

				<section class="mb-12">
					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">For Dungeon Masters, By Dungeon Masters</h2>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						Every feature in Initiative Tracker comes from real experience running D&D games. We've DM'd for years across:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-muted-foreground space-y-2 mb-4">
						<li>In-person sessions around kitchen tables</li>
						<li>Online games through virtual tabletops</li>
						<li>Convention one-shots with strangers</li>
						<li>Epic long-running campaigns</li>
						<li>Quick pick-up games at game stores</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						We've felt the pain points firsthand and built solutions that actually work at the table. Features aren't added because they sound cool - they're added because they solve real problems that DMs face.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section class="mb-12">
					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Community & Feedback</h2>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						Initiative Tracker is constantly evolving based on feedback from the D&D community. We've listened to Dungeon Masters from around the world about what they need, what frustrates them, and what would make their games better.
					</p>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						Your feedback shapes the future of this tool. Every feature request is considered. Every bug report makes the tracker better. We're building this for you - the DMs who keep the game alive.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section class="mb-12">
					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Our Values</h2>

					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Accessibility</h3>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						Great tools shouldn't be locked behind paywalls. D&D is for everyone, and so are the tools that support it.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Simplicity</h3>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						Complexity doesn't equal quality. We focus on features that genuinely help, not on adding options for the sake of it.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Privacy</h3>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						Your data is yours. We don't collect it, track it, or profit from it. Period.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Quality</h3>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						Every feature is polished and tested. We'd rather have fewer features that work perfectly than many features that work poorly.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Community</h3>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
						D&D thrives on community. We listen, adapt, and build based on what DMs actually need.
					</p>
