					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Features & Functionality</h2>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">How many combatants can I track?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							There's no hard limit! You can add as many combatants as you need. The tracker performs well even with 50+ creatures. For massive battles, we recommend using grouped units (e.g., "Goblin Squad 1-5" instead of individual goblins).
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Can I track multiple encounters simultaneously?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							The tracker displays one encounter at a time, but you can save unlimited encounters and switch between them instantly. Open the tracker in multiple browser tabs to run multiple encounters in parallel.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">How do I use the AI encounter generator?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							Click the "AI Assistant" button and describe your desired encounter in plain English. Include party size, level, and difficulty (e.g., "Medium encounter for 4 level 3 players in a forest"). The AI will suggest appropriate monsters and tactics.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Does the AI encounter generator require an API key?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							No! Unlike most AI tools, our encounter generator works out of the box with no setup, no API keys, and no configuration. You get 20 AI-powered encounter generations per day for fair usage across all users.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Which monsters are included in the database?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							The tracker includes 300+ monsters from the D&D 5e System Reference Document (SRD). This includes classic monsters like goblins, dragons, undead, and more. Monsters from non-SRD sources (like Volo's Guide or Mordenkainen's) are not included due to licensing.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Can I add custom monsters or player characters?</h3>

					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Can I duplicate a creature for multiple enemies?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">

						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">How do I reorder initiative mid-combat?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							Click and drag any row using the grip handle on the left side. This lets you manually reorder initiative when effects like Ready action or Slow spell change the turn order.
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section class="mb-12">
					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Data & Privacy</h2>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Where is my data stored?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							All your encounters and settings are stored locally in your browser's local storage. Nothing is sent to external servers except when using the AI features, which only send your encounter description (no personal data).
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Is my data private?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							Yes! Your encounters, player data, and settings never leave your device. We don't collect, track, or store any personal information. The tracker respects your privacy completely.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">What happens if I clear my browser data?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							Clearing your browser's cache and cookies will delete all saved encounters and settings. We recommend exporting important encounters regularly as backups.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Can I export my encounters?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							Yes! Use the export feature in the Encounters drawer to download your encounters as a JSON file. You can import this file on other devices or share it with other Dungeon Masters.
						</p>
					</div>

				<div class="mb-8">
					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Can I sync encounters across devices?</h3>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground">
						Currently, data is device-specific. To use encounters on multiple devices, export them from one device and import on another.
					</p>
				</div>
				</section>

				<section class="mb-12">
					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">D&D Rules & Mechanics</h2>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Does this work with other RPG systems?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							The tracker is optimized for D&D 5e but can be adapted for any turn-based RPG system. The core initiative tracking works universally, though monster database and some features are D&D-specific.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">How are initiative ties handled?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							When creatures have the same initiative, D&D 5e rules state that the one with the higher Dexterity modifier goes first. If still tied, the DM decides. Use drag-and-drop to manually order tied initiatives.
						</p>
					</div>

				<div class="mb-8">
					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Does it track spell slots or resources?</h3>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground">
						Currently, the tracker focuses on initiative and hit points. Use the Notes field to track these manually.
					</p>
				</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Can it handle legendary actions?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							Legendary actions are viewable in monster stat blocks. The tracker doesn't automate legendary action tracking yet, but you can use the Notes field to mark when they're used.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">What about lair actions?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							Add a custom "Lair Actions" entry with initiative 20 (loses ties). Use the Notes field to describe the lair action that triggers each round.
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section class="mb-12">
					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Troubleshooting</h2>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Why isn't the monster autocomplete working?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							The monster database loads on first visit. If autocomplete isn't showing suggestions, refresh the page. Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser. Once loaded, monsters work offline.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">The AI isn't generating encounters. What's wrong?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							AI generation requires an internet connection. If you're getting errors, you may have reached the daily limit of 20 generations, or the service may be experiencing high traffic. Try again later or the next day. The limit resets daily at midnight UTC.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">My saved encounters disappeared. How do I recover them?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							If you cleared browser data or switched to private browsing, encounters may be lost. Check if you have an export backup. Unfortunately, without backups, data cannot be recovered. We recommend regular exports of important encounters.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">The tracker is slow with many creatures. How do I fix it?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							For encounters with 50+ creatures, consider grouping similar enemies (e.g., "5 Goblins" as one entry, updating HP accordingly). The tracker handles large groups but UI responsiveness improves with fewer rows.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Some columns are missing on mobile. Is this a bug?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							No, this is intentional. On small screens, less critical columns are hidden to improve readability. Rotate to landscape mode or use a larger screen to see all columns.
						</p>
					</div>

				<section class="mb-12">
					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Support & Development</h2>


				<div class="mb-8">
					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Will there be mobile apps?</h3>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground">
						The web version works great on mobile! The progressive web app experience provides offline support and mobile optimization.
					</p>
				</div>

				<section class="mb-12">
					<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Legal & Licensing</h2>

					<div class="mb-8">
						<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Is this affiliated with Wizards of the Coast?</h3>
						<p class="text-muted-foreground">
							No. This is an independent fan project. D&D, Dungeons & Dragons, and Wizards of the Coast are trademarks of Wizards of the Coast LLC. Monster data comes from the SRD under the Open Gaming License.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="mb-8">

							Yes! The initiative tracker itself is free to use for any purpose including commercial games. However, be aware of D&D's licensing terms if you're publishing D&D content.
						</p>
					</div>

				<div class="mb-8">
					<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Can I embed this on my website?</h3>
					<p class="text-muted-foreground">
						Currently, embedding isn't officially supported, but you can link to the tracker from your site. Iframe embedding may work but isn't guaranteed.
